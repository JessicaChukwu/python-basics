# Automated Greenhouse & Sensor Simulation

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based simulation designed to monitor and manage environmental conditions within a greenhouse. It demonstrates the use of conditional logic and modular programming to automate climate control based on sensor triggers.

## Key Features
* **Automated Logic:** Uses sensor data simulations to trigger environmental adjustments (e.g., temperature and moisture control).
* **Modular Design:** Implemented using functions to ensure code maintainability and readability.
* **Data Validation:** Ensures that "sensor" inputs are within logical bounds before executing system responses.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Programming Logic:** Complex if-else structures and loops for real-time monitoring.
* **Problem Solving:** Designing a software solution for hardware-based environmental challenges.
* **Python Basics:** Effective use of variables, functions, and standard libraries.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run `python 1020_green_house_project.py` in your terminal.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to simulate sensor inputs.
